## Commands

### User Commands (arc-*)

These are your main entry points - designed for direct use when working on problems.

---

#### `/arc-investigate` - Automated Troubleshooting

**Purpose**: Complete troubleshooting workflow that systematically investigates your problem and gives you evidence-based solutions.

**How It Works**:
1. **Documents the problem** - Captures what you've been working on from the current session
2. **Generates theories** - Creates 5-6 hypotheses about what's causing the issue
3. **Validates in parallel** - Tests each theory through code investigation (runs simultaneously for speed)
4. **Ranks results** - Organizes findings into actionable categories
5. **Presents action plan** - Gives you clear next steps

**Results Categories**:
- 🔴 **PROVEN** - Confirmed root causes (fix these immediately!)
- 🟡 **High Confidence** - Strong evidence but needs verification
- 🟢 **Worth Investigating** - Plausible but needs more data
- ⚫ **Ruled Out** - Disproven theories (don't waste time here)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Let Claude extract problem from current session
/arc-investigate

# Use an existing problem context file
/arc-investigate .problem.20250108-143022.md
```

**Example Session**:
```
You: I'm stuck on this rendering bug in UserProfile
[... debugging conversation ...]

You: /arc-investigate

Claude: Investigating the rendering issue in UserProfile...

Generated 5 theories. Validating in parallel...

# Investigation Results

## 🔴 PROVEN Root Causes

### State Mutation at Line 45
**Evidence**: Direct mutation of state array found
**Fix**: Use immutable update pattern
**Steps**:
1. Change tasks.push() to setTasks([...tasks, newTask])
2. Verify re-rendering works
3. Check for similar patterns elsewhere

## 🟡 High Confidence

### Missing Key Props in List
**Evidence**: React warning in console, no keys on mapped elements
**Verification needed**: Add keys and check if residual issues remain

## ⚫ Ruled Out

### Stale Closure in useEffect
**Why**: Effect dependencies are correct, cleanup properly implemented

---

What would you like to do?
1. Fix the proven state mutation issue
2. Verify the key props theory
3. Generate external LLM prompt
```

**When to Use**:
- ✅ You're stuck on a problem and don't know where to start
- ✅ You want to explore multiple possible causes efficiently
- ✅ You need evidence-based direction, not guesses
- ✅ You want to avoid going down wrong debugging paths

**Pro Tips**:
- Run this early when stuck - don't spend hours debugging manually first
- The parallel validation makes this fast (5-6 theories validated simultaneously)
- If all theories are uncertain, consider using `/arc-llm` for external perspective
- You can re-run with additional context if initial results aren't conclusive

---

#### `/arc-rca` - Root Cause Analysis

**Purpose**: Forensic investigation that traces bugs back to their origin, helping you understand how they were introduced and how to prevent them in the future.

**How It Works**:
1. **Extracts context** - Automatically gathers info from your session (or uses provided details)
2. **Determines status** - Figures out if bug is fixed or still being worked on
3. **Git forensics** - Uses git blame, git log, and history analysis
4. **Analyzes intent** - Understands what the original developer was trying to do
5. **Classifies cause** - Identifies the type of mistake (logic error, edge case, refactor issue, etc.)
6. **Vets fix** - For fixed bugs, checks if the solution is complete and sound
7. **Finds similar risks** - Searches for other code with the same pattern
8. **Prevention recommendations** - Suggests how to prevent this category of bug

**Usage**:
```bash
# Auto-extract from current session (most common)
/arc-rca

# Analyze a specific commit
/arc-rca commit abc123

# Analyze a specific bug by description
/arc-rca "authentication tokens expiring immediately"

# Analyze a bug with ticket reference
/arc-rca JIRA-1234
```

**Example Session** (After Fixing a Bug):
```
You: [Just fixed token expiration bug and committed]

You: /arc-rca

Claude: Analyzing root cause of token expiration bug...

# Root Cause Analysis Report

## Bug Summary
Authentication tokens expired immediately instead of 24 hours

**Status**: Fixed in commit abc123
**Affected**: src/auth/tokenService.ts

## Root Cause Investigation

**Breaking Change**: commit def456 on 2024-12-15
**Original Intent**: Refactor to eliminate magic numbers
**What Happened**:
- Developer created time.DAY constant (86400000 ms)
- Used it with jwt.sign({ expiresIn: time.DAY })
- JWT library expects SECONDS, not milliseconds
- Tokens expired in 86.4 seconds instead of 86,400 seconds

**Classification**: Integration Issue
- JWT library API expects seconds
- JavaScript time constants use milliseconds
- Mismatch wasn't caught in testing

## Fix Quality Assessment

**Status**: ✅ Fixes the immediate issue
**Concerns**:
- Similar bug found in redis.ts:34 (same pattern)
- Fix uses magic number (multiply by 1000)
- Better approach: Create time.toSeconds() utility

## Similar Bug Risk

Found 1 other location with same pattern:
- `src/cache/redis.ts:34` - Uses time.HOUR for Redis TTL
  **Action Required**: Likely has same bug, needs immediate fix

## Prevention Recommendations

**Testing**: Add integration test for token expiration duration
**Code Review**: Check unit expectations when refactoring time constants
**Tooling**: TypeScript branded types for Milliseconds vs Seconds
**Documentation**: Document units in time utility comments
**Process**: Create conversion utilities (toSeconds, toMillis)

---

What would you like to do?
1. Fix the similar bug in redis.ts
2. Create time.toSeconds() utility
3. Add integration tests
4. See full detailed analysis
```

**Example Session** (Unfixed Bug):
```
You: [Working on memory leak, haven't fixed it yet]

You: /arc-rca

Claude: Analyzing root cause of memory leak...

The bug appears to be unfixed. Based on investigation:

**Likely Introduced**: commit xyz789 (WebSocket refactor)
**Suspected Issue**: Event listeners not being cleaned up
**Affected**: src/services/socketService.ts:67

**Recommendation**: The analysis is preliminary since the bug isn't
fixed yet. For a complete root cause analysis, fix the bug first
and re-run /arc-rca to get full timeline, fix vetting, and prevention
recommendations.

Would you like to:
1. See investigation details
2. Use /arc-investigate for systematic debugging
3. Continue with manual debugging
```

**When to Use**:
- ✅ **After fixing a bug** - Understand how it was introduced (best time!)
- ✅ **During post-mortems** - Learn from production incidents
- ✅ **Before merging fixes** - Verify your fix is complete
- ✅ **When patterns repeat** - Understand why the same bugs keep happening
- ✅ **For code reviews** - Analyze bugs found during review

**Pro Tips**:
- Run this immediately after fixing a bug while context is fresh
- The git forensics can trace bugs back months or years
- Similar bug detection often finds other instances of the same mistake
- Prevention recommendations help improve your team's processes
- For unfixed bugs, you'll get preliminary insights but full analysis requires a fix

#### `/arc-llm` - External LLM Consultation

**Purpose**: Generates a comprehensive, self-contained prompt that you can copy-paste into ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or any other LLM to get external help.

**Why This Exists**: Sometimes you need a second opinion or want to consult a specialized model. This command packages up your entire problem with all necessary code context so the other LLM doesn't need filesystem access.

**How It Works**:
1. **Documents problem** - Captures your current issue from the session
2. **Reads all relevant files** - Extracts code sections mentioned in the problem
3. **Includes architecture** - Adds framework, dependencies, project structure
4. **Packages context** - Creates 200-500 lines of comprehensive, standalone prompt
5. **Displays for copying** - Shows the prompt ready to paste elsewhere

**Usage**:
```bash
# Extract from current session
/arc-llm

# Use existing problem context
/arc-llm .problem.20250108-143022.md
```

**Example Output**:
```
Generated LLM consultation prompt (copy the text below):

────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Problem Consultation Request

I need help solving a rendering issue in my React + TypeScript project.

## Problem Description

UserProfile component doesn't re-render when user data changes. The state
update happens (confirmed via console logs) but the UI remains stale.

## Project Context

**Framework/Stack**: React 18.2 + TypeScript 5.0 + Vite
**Key Dependencies**:
- react: 18.2.0
- react-router-dom: 6.8.0

**Project Structure**:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── UserProfile.tsx  (problem here)
│   └── ...
├── hooks/
│   └── useUserData.ts   (state management)
└── types/
    └── user.ts          (type definitions)
```

## Relevant Code

### src/components/UserProfile.tsx
```typescript
// Lines 1-65
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useUserData } from '../hooks/useUserData';
import { User } from '../types/user';

export const UserProfile: React.FC = () => {
  const { user, updateUser } = useUserData();

  const handleUpdate = (newData: Partial<User>) => {
    // State update happens here
    updateUser(newData);
    console.log('Updated:', newData); // This logs correctly
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>  {/* This doesn't update! */}
      <p>{user.email}</p>
      <button onClick={() => handleUpdate({ name: 'New Name' })}>
        Update Name
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Context**: Main profile component. The console.log shows updates happening
but the rendered name stays the same.

### src/hooks/useUserData.ts
```typescript
// Lines 1-30
import { useState } from 'react';
import { User } from '../types/user';

export const useUserData = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User>({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  });

  const updateUser = (updates: Partial<User>) => {
    // Line 45: Direct mutation (suspicious!)
    Object.assign(user, updates);
    setUser(user);
  };

  return { user, updateUser };
};
```

**Context**: Custom hook for user state management.

### src/types/user.ts
```typescript
// Lines 1-10
export interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatar?: string;
}
```

## What's Been Tried

1. Added console.logs - confirmed state updates are called
2. Checked React DevTools - state shows old value
3. Tried forcing re-render with key prop - didn't help
4. Verified component is properly imported and used

## Error Messages / Symptoms

No error messages in console. Component simply doesn't reflect state changes.
Console logs show the update function is called with correct data.

## Questions

1. Why isn't the component re-rendering when state changes?
2. Is there an issue with how we're updating state in the custom hook?
3. What's the proper pattern for this use case?

- Google Gemini (gemini.google.com)
- Claude (claude.ai)
- Any other LLM
```

**What Makes This Different from .problem.md**:
- **.problem.md** uses file:line references (assumes filesystem access)
- **arc-llm output** includes all code inline (no filesystem needed)
- **.problem.md** is for internal use or sharing with Claude
- **arc-llm output** is for external LLMs without context

**When to Use**:
- ✅ `/arc-investigate` didn't find the solution
- ✅ You want a second opinion from a different AI model
- ✅ You need specialized expertise (e.g., specific framework knowledge)
- ✅ You want to consult a model with different training data
- ✅ You're working on a problem that benefits from multiple perspectives
- ✅ You need to share the problem with a colleague who uses a different LLM

**Pro Tips**:
- The generated prompt is already well-formatted for LLMs
- Code snippets include line numbers as comments for reference
- Architectural context helps other LLMs understand your setup
- You can edit the prompt before pasting if you want to add more context
- Works great with specialized models (e.g., Gemini for Google Cloud issues)

---

### Utility Commands (ca-*)

#### ca-store-problem-context

Creates a `.problem.[timestamp].md` file documenting the current problem you're working on. This file is formatted as a detailed prompt to an LLM, including relevant context, file references, and questions. Useful for:
- Getting help from another LLM or AI system
- Documenting complex problems for later reference
- Creating reproducible problem reports

**Usage**: `/ca-store-problem-context`

## Agents

### User Agents (arc-*)

These agents can be invoked directly using the Task tool for specialized analysis.

---

#### `arc-root-cause-analyzer` - Forensic Bug Analysis Agent

**Purpose**: Deep forensic investigation that uses git history to trace bugs back to their origin, understand why they happened, and provide actionable prevention strategies.

**This is the engine behind `/arc-rca`** - You typically use `/arc-rca` command instead of calling this agent directly, but you can invoke it directly for custom analysis workflows.

**How It Works**:
1. **Git archaeology** - Uses git blame, git log, and git history to find when buggy code was introduced
2. **Context analysis** - Reads commit messages, PR descriptions, and related changes to understand developer intent
3. **Timeline construction** - Maps out when bug was introduced, discovered, and fixed
4. **Root cause classification** - Categorizes the mistake (logic error, edge case, incomplete refactor, integration issue, etc.)
5. **Fix vetting** - For fixed bugs, analyzes if the solution is complete, correct, and sustainable
6. **Pattern detection** - Searches codebase for similar code that might have the same bug
7. **Prevention synthesis** - Recommends specific testing, tooling, documentation, and process improvements

**Usage** (via Task tool):
```
Use the arc-root-cause-analyzer agent to analyze:

Bug: Authentication tokens expiring immediately
Status: Fixed in commit abc123
Files: src/auth/tokenService.ts
What changed: Modified expiresIn calculation from time.DAY to time.DAY / 1000
```

**What You Get**:

**1. Breaking Change Analysis**
- Exact commit that introduced the bug
- What the code looked like before and after
- What the developer was trying to accomplish
- Related changes that provide context

**2. Root Cause Classification**
Choose from categories like:
- Logic Error (incorrect implementation)
- Edge Case (missing handling of uncommon scenario)
- Incomplete Refactoring (refactor missed updating related code)
- Integration Issue (components interact unexpectedly)
- Dependency Change (library behavior changed)
- Merge Conflict (conflict resolution introduced bug)
- Specification Gap (requirements unclear)

**3. Timeline Analysis**
- When bug was introduced
- How long before discovery
- Time to fix
- Key events in the bug's lifecycle

**4. Fix Quality Assessment** (for fixed bugs)
- Is the fix complete or a workaround?
- Does it address root cause or just symptoms?
- Could it introduce new issues?
- Are there tests to prevent regression?
- Confidence level in the fix

**5. Similar Bug Detection**
- Other locations with the same pattern
- Risk assessment for each location
- Recommended audit tasks

**6. Prevention Recommendations**
Specific suggestions across:
- **Testing**: What tests would have caught this?
- **Code Review**: What should reviewers look for?
- **Tooling**: What linters/types/tools would help?
- **Documentation**: What docs would prevent this?
- **Process**: What process changes would help?

**Example Direct Invocation**:
```
You: I need forensic analysis on the caching bug we had last week

Claude: [Uses Task tool to invoke arc-root-cause-analyzer]

Agent produces:

# Root Cause Analysis Report

## Breaking Change
**Commit**: def789 on 2024-11-15
**Message**: "Optimize cache key generation"
**Intent**: Improve performance by simplifying cache keys

**What Changed**:
```javascript
// Before (working)
const cacheKey = `${userId}_${resource}_${timestamp}`;

// After (introduced bug)
const cacheKey = `${userId}_${resource}`; // Removed timestamp!
```

**Root Cause**: Logic Error + Performance Optimization Gone Wrong
- Developer removed timestamp to increase cache hits
- Didn't realize timestamp was preventing stale data bugs
- Cache now serves stale data across requests

## Fix Quality Assessment
**Status**: ⚠️ Workaround, not root cause fix
**Current fix**: Added cache TTL of 5 seconds
**Problem**: Doesn't address why timestamp was removed
**Better approach**: Keep timestamp, use Redis cache with intelligent invalidation

## Similar Bugs Found
- `src/services/profileCache.ts:45` - Same pattern, same risk
- `src/utils/apiCache.ts:23` - Similar but has TTL already

## Prevention
**Testing**: Integration test with concurrent requests would have caught this
**Code Review**: Performance changes should verify correctness isn't broken
**Process**: Performance optimizations need explicit approval from tech lead
```

**When to Use Directly**:
- Building custom workflows that need RCA as part of a larger process
- Analyzing multiple bugs in batch
- Integrating with external tools or scripts
- Creating automated post-mortem reports

**Note**: Most users should use `/arc-rca` command instead, which calls this agent automatically.

### Utility Agents (ca-*)

#### ca-brainstormer

Analyzes a problem and generates 5-6 evidence-based theories about what might be causing it. The agent investigates the codebase first, checking basic assumptions and gathering evidence before suggesting causes.

**Usage**:
- Provide a problem context file (`.problem.[timestamp].md`) when invoking
- Or provide a detailed problem description in the same format
- If no problem file exists, create one first (either with `/ca-store-problem-context` or manually in the same style)

**What it does**:
- Verifies basic assumptions (files exist, imports correct, syntax valid, etc.)
- Investigates relevant files and recent changes
- Generates 5-6 possible causes ordered by likelihood
- Provides evidence, causal explanation, and verification steps for each theory

**Example**: "Use the ca-brainstormer agent with the problem context from `.problem.20250108-143022.md`"

#### ca-problem-theory-validator

Rigorously vets a single theory about a problem's cause through systematic investigation. Attempts to prove or disprove the theory, and if neither is conclusive, provides concrete steps to gather the necessary data.

**Usage**:
- Provide a problem context file (`.problem.[timestamp].md`)
- Specify which theory to validate (by number or full text)
- If no problem file exists, create one first (via `/ca-store-problem-context` or manually)

**What it does**:
- Investigates each claim in the theory systematically
- Gathers supporting and contradicting evidence with file references
- Verifies assumptions through code examination and testing
- Reaches one of three conclusions: PROVEN, DISPROVEN, or UNCERTAIN
- Provides actionable next steps based on the conclusion

**Example**: "Use the ca-problem-theory-validator agent to validate theory #2 from `.problem.20250108-143022.md`"

## FAQ & Tips

### How do these tools work together?

**arc-investigate** → Finding the bug (generates & validates theories)
**arc-rca** → Understanding the bug (traces origin, prevents recurrence)
**arc-llm** → Getting external help (packages problem for other LLMs)

They complement each other: investigate to find, rca to understand, llm for second opinions.

### When should I use /arc-investigate vs /arc-rca?

- **Before fixing**: Use `/arc-investigate` - helps you find and fix the bug
- **After fixing**: Use `/arc-rca` - helps you understand and prevent it

### Can I use arc-rca on unfixed bugs?

Yes! It will provide preliminary insights but recommends re-running after the fix for complete analysis including fix vetting and timeline.

### Do I need to provide information to these commands?

Usually no - they extract context from your current Claude Code session. You can provide specific details if needed (like commit hashes or bug IDs).

### What if arc-investigate doesn't find the answer?

- Review the "Worth Investigating" theories and gather suggested data
- Use `/arc-llm` to get a second opinion from ChatGPT or Gemini
- Re-run with more specific problem description
- Sometimes bugs need deeper manual investigation first

### How long does /arc-investigate take?

Typically 1-2 minutes. The parallel validation of theories makes it fast - all 5-6 theories are checked simultaneously.

### Does arc-rca work on old bugs?

Yes! As long as the code is in git history, it can trace back months or years to find when the bug was introduced.

### Can I use these tools for non-bugs?

- **arc-investigate**: Yes, works for any technical problem (performance issues, unexpected behavior, configuration problems)
- **arc-rca**: Primarily for bugs, but can analyze any problematic code change
- **arc-llm**: Works for any problem you need help with

### What's the .problem.*.md file for?

Internal working file that captures problem context with file:line references. Used by other commands as input. Follows the `.*.md` gitignore pattern.

### Do I need to install anything?

Installation scripts coming soon. For now, manually copy the command and agent files to your Claude Code configuration directories.
